# Contoso-analytic-dashboard

The objective of this project is to develop a sales analytics tool for analyzing sales performance. Not only supporting as a report, this dashboard was built also for analysis purpose.

To systematically analyze sales and the influencing factors, I employed a logic tree, which is a framework for critical thinking. Various aspects such as segmentation, process structure, algebraic structures, and more have been considered within this approach. The resulting dashboard is constructed based on this well-defined approach.
